Virtual Interface Driver installation

The virtual interface driver can be installed automatically by using the
ovirt-host-deploy vdsm hook installation mechanism.
This allows two basic ways of installation:
- copy the hook files to the hooks directly on vdsm
- install required rpm's by specifying the rpm's in a file


Copying hook files.

The ovirt-host-deploy vdsm hook will copy all files from
/usr/share/ovirt-host-deploy/plugins/ovirt-host-deploy/vdsmhooks/hooks.d\
on the engine, to the vdsm hook directly on the installed host (/usr/libexec/vdsm/hooks).


Installing rpm's from list.

A file with the list of rpm's to be installed must be placed in the
following directory in the engine:
/usr/share/ovirt-host-deploy/plugins/ovirt-host-deploy/vdsmhooks/packages.d\

There should be a separate file for each linux distribution. The file extension 
must be the name of the linux distribution on which the rpm's are to be installed
(fedora, redhat, ...).

For example:
hooks.fedora
-------------------
vdsmdummy-driver.rpm
other-driver.rpm


Custom installation

If a more sophisticated method of driver installation is required, a custom
ovirt-host-deploy plugin must be added. An example will be prepared in the near future.
