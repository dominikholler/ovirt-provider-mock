Starting provider mock
----------------------

If installing from the rpm, execute the following:
    run-provider-mock

If running from a git repository
    cd providermock
    python httpServer.py


Solving connectivity problems
-----------------------------

The provider mock is using the following ports:
  9696 - neutron mock
  35357 - keystone mock

Please ensure that these are accesible by oVirt.
Firewalld, iptables or any other firewall must be checked if oVirt engine
can not connect to the mock.
These can either switched off:
  service firewalld stop
  service iptables stop
or configured to allow traffic on these ports. The configuration will depend
on the environment setup.
The following command opens iptables on the ports required:
  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9696 -j ACCEPT
  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 35357 -j ACCEPT
Please consult the man pages for the specific configuration that suits your
setup.


Debuging
---------------

Issuing the follwing rest query:
  http://<host>:9696/v2.0/debug
will dump all the entities present in the mock.
